We aim to enhance the shopping experience for visually impaired individuals. Our solution incorporates the following components:

- Device cameras for image capture
- Azure object detection for identifying objects
- Azure text-to-speech for converting text to audio
- Azure form recognizer for extracting information from forms

To bring this solution to life, we are developing a dedicated app. Our trained model achieves a precision rate of 60% and a recall rate of 90.1%.
