# Project: Assistive Shopping App for the Visually Impaired


Welcome to our project on the Assistive Shopping App for the Visually Impaired! We participated in a competition where we leveraged Azure's object detection with a precision rate of 60% and a recall rate of 90.1%. In addition, we utilized Azure Form Recognizer and Azure Speech-to-Text services to develop an app that assists visually impaired individuals in their shopping experience.

## Competition Overview

In the competition, our goal was to create an innovative solution that addressed the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals while shopping. We focused on harnessing the power of Azure's object detection capabilities to identify products, Azure Form Recognizer to extract information from product labels, and Azure Speech-to-Text to convert text into audio for the users.

## App Features

Our Assistive Shopping App offers the following key features:

1. **Object Detection:** Leveraging Azure's object detection, the app can detect and identify various products placed in front of the device's camera. This enables visually impaired users to understand and interact with their surroundings more effectively.

2. **Product Information Extraction:** By utilizing Azure Form Recognizer, the app can extract relevant information from product labels, such as product names, prices, and descriptions. This information is then made accessible to users through audio feedback.

3. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Azure's Speech-to-Text service is integrated into the app, allowing it to convert extracted text into audio output. Users can hear the information about the identified products, making it easier for them to make informed decisions while shopping.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The app features an intuitive and accessible user interface, designed specifically for visually impaired individuals. It incorporates high contrast, large fonts, and voice-guided instructions to ensure a seamless and inclusive user experience.

## Conclusion

The Assistive Shopping App for the Visually Impaired demonstrates our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address real-world challenges. By combining Azure's object detection, Form Recognizer, and Speech-to-Text services, we have developed an app that empowers visually impaired individuals during their shopping journeys. We believe that technology can play a transformative role in creating more inclusive and accessible experiences for everyone.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we look forward to making a positive impact with the Assistive Shopping App!
